<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

  <p>A rumour is going about that martial law may be declared in Ireland at
  any moment. By which of the armies of occupation does not seem clear.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>To make money, says a London magistrate, one must work hard. This is a
  great improvement on the present method of entering a post-office and
  helping yourself.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Cat skins are advertised for in Essex. A suburban resident writes to
  say he has a few brace on his garden wall each night, if the advertiser
  is prepared to entice the cats from inside them.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Much alarm has been caused in foreign countries by the report that
  British scientists are experimenting with a machine that makes a noise
  like Lord <font class="sc">Fisher</font>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>According to a witness at a police court in London nearly two hundred
  people stood and watched a fight between dockers in City Road last week.
  The way some people take advantage of Mr. <font
  class="sc">Cochran's</font> absence in America seems most
  unsportsmanlike.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Horse-radish from Germany is being sold in Manchester at six shillings
  a bundle. Even during the War, thanks to the efforts of the local Press,
  the Mancunian has never wanted for his little bit of German hot
  stuff.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Asked how old he was by the magistrate a railway-worker is said to
  have replied, "Thirty-nine last strike."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The House of Representatives at Washington have offered one hundred
  thousand pounds to fight the influenza germ. It is said that, if they
  will make it two hundred thousand, <font class="sc">Dempsey's</font>
  manager will consider it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>An American millionaire, says a gossip, has decided to stay at one
  London hotel for three months. There was no need to tell us he was a
  millionaire.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A way is said to have been found for washing linen by electricity. In
  future patrons will have to tear the button-holes themselves.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is all very well asking Germany to hand over her war criminals, but
  the trouble is to find enough innocent men to round them up.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The rumour current in France, to the effect that our <font
  class="sc">Premier</font> has been seen in London, is believed by
  Parisians to have been spread by political rivals.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Bolshevists recently deported from America were welcomed on the
  Finnish frontier by the Red Army and eleven brass bands playing "The
  International." That ought to teach them to get deported again.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A Thames bargee has summoned a colleague for throwing a huge piece of
  coal at him. Quite right too. The coal might have fallen into the
  river.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>One Scottish M.P., says a weekly paper, has not made a speech in the
  House of Commons for twenty years. This is probably due to the fact that
  a Scotsman rarely butts in when a fellow-countryman is speaking.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The so-called "pneumonia" blouse is conducive to health, declares the
  Medical Research Committee. On the other hand the sunstroke cravat
  continues to prove fatal in a great number of cases.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A Swansea man who went to his allotment to dig up some parsnips and
  ended by taking three cabbages from a neighbour's plot has been fined ten
  pounds. We approve of the sentence. A man who deliberately associates
  with parsnips should be shown no mercy.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A news message states that passports enabling Mr. <font
  class="sc">Ramsay Macdonald</font> to proceed to Russia have been
  refused. As a result we understand that the well-known Socialist has
  threatened to remain in this country.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Greenwich Council has refused a war trophy, consisting of a hundred
  bayonets. It appears that in those parts they still adhere to the
  fantastic theory that the chronometer won the War.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A novel idea is reported from a small town in Norfolk. It appears that
  at the annual fancy-dress ball all the inhabitants clubbed together and
  went as a Brontosaurus.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Hotel Métropole has now been vacated by the Government, and it is
  thought that, as soon as the extra sleeping accommodation has been
  cleared away, it will be used as an hotel once again.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We understand there is no truth in the rumour that Mr. <font
  class="sc">Albert de Courville</font> has offered the ex-Kaiser a leading
  part in his revue, <i>Come Over Here</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A correspondent points out in <i>The Daily Express</i> that there are
  five Sundays in the present month. We understand however that Mr. <font
  class="sc">Winston Churchill</font> is not to blame this time.</p>

<h4>"Our Invincible Navy."</h4>

  <p>In the article which appeared under the above title in the issue of
  <i>Punch</i> for January 14th, the setting of the nautical episode, in
  which the subject of the story conducted himself with so much aplomb and
  resourcefulness, was derived from a personal experience related to the
  author; but Mr. Punch has his assurance that <i>Reginald McTaggart</i>
  was not intended even remotely to represent any actual individual.</p>

<hr />

<h2>HIS FUTURE.</h2>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">Part I.&mdash;The Proposal, 1920.</font></p>

  <p>"About this boy of ours, my dear," said Gerald.</p>

  <p>"Well, what about it?" said Margaret. "He weighed fourteen pounds and
  an eighth this morning, and he's only four months and ten days old, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"Is he? I mean, does he? Splendid. But what I was going to say was
  this: in view of the present social and economic disturbances and the
  price of coal and butter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He doesn't need either of those yet, dear."</p>

  <p>"&mdash;and the price of coal and butter, it behoves us, don't you
  think, to very seriously consider (yes, I meant to split it)&mdash;to
  very seriously consider Nat's future?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I've been doing that for ever so long, Gerald. Probably in a year
  or two we shan't be able to get even a general or a char, so I'm going to
  teach him all sorts of household jobs&mdash;as a great treat, of course.
  Washing up the plates and dishes and laying fires&mdash;oh, and darning
  as well. He must certainly mend his own socks, and yours too."</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps, if he has time. But I have a much better proposal to
  make than that. My idea is that we should bring him up to be a
  miner."</p>

  <p>"I thought children under twenty-one always were."</p>

  <p>"Not minor, silly&mdash;miner."</p>

  <p>"Well, what's the difference? Saying it twice doesn't help. And
  neither does shouting," she added.</p>

  <p>Gerald wrote it down.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I <i>see</i>. But why?"</p>

  <p>"Because then he can earn enough money to keep us all
  comfortably&mdash;us in idle dependence at Chelsea, him in idle
  independence at Merthyr-Tydfil or wherever one mines."</p>

  <p>"He might send us diamonds now and then too. Or perhaps it isn't
  allowed."</p>

  <p>"No, no. He'll be a coal-miner, naturally."</p>

  <p>Margaret pondered this for some minutes.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think much of your idea," she said finally. "Very likely
  coal will have gone out of fashion by then and we shall all be warming
  ourselves with Cape gooseberries or pine-kernels or something. I think he
  ought to be taught <i>all</i> kinds of mining&mdash;diamond-mining,
  salt-mining, gold-mining and undermining at Lloyd's. Then be could take
  up whatever was most profitable at the moment."</p>

  <p>"He has a busy youth ahead of him, I see. Have you thought of anything
  else?"</p>

  <p>"Not at present. Don't you think, though, that this little talk of
  ours has been rather instructive, Gerald? Shall we open a correspondence
  in <i>The Literary Supplement</i> on 'The Boy: What Will He Become'?"</p>

  <p>"Not quite the sort of thing for their readers, I should say."</p>

  <p>"But surely some of them must be quite human. It isn't as if I'd said
  <i>Notes and Queries</i>. One can't imagine the readers of that
  ever&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen!" said Gerald. "I think I hear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Margaret had vanished. Nat's already pessimistic views on his
  future were being published for the benefit of the Man in the Street.</p>

<h2>SPORTING GOLF.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>With the British Army in France.</i>)</p>

  <p>"I noticed the old sapper instinct asserting itself in Mac when he
  tried to tunnel out of that bunker at the seventh," said Denny after tea
  in the golf club-house. "He'd have found some opportunities on a really
  sporting course like ours at Villers-Vereux. Remember Villers,
  Ponting?"</p>

  <p>"It wasn't a golf links as I remember it," said Ponting grimly.</p>

  <p>"Bless you, I'm not speaking of those far-away days. I'm talking of a
  month or two back, when I was there with a Chinese Salvage Company trying
  to clear up the mess you made. Beastly quiet it was, too. The only
  excitement was a playful habit the Chink had contracted of picking up a
  rusty rifle and a salvaged clip of cartridges, pointing the gun anywhere
  and pulling the trigger to make it say <i>Bang!</i> I often found myself
  doin' the old B.E.F. tummy-wriggle when the <i>Chinois</i> was really
  happy.</p>

  <p>"One Sunday&mdash;a non-working day&mdash;when all was drab and dreary
  and existence seemed a double-blank, my orderly mentioned that he had
  discovered some old 'golfing bats' in one of the hutments. Evidently they
  were the remains of the spoils of a lightning foray on the Base. A
  further search revealed a couple of elliptical balls, quite good in
  places. So I tipped my cub, Laxey, out of his bunk and we proceeded to
  resurrect our pre-war form. By-and-by we got adventurous, and Laxey
  challenged me to play him a match after lunch for ten francs a side. The
  details required some arranging, as there were no greens or holes, but
  eventually we decided on a cross-country stroke competition, starting
  from the hut-door and finishing at a crump hole, map ref.: B 26c,
  08,35.</p>

  <p>"We tossed for clubs, and as I won I picked a driver and a hockey
  stick, leaving Laxey a brassie and a putter head tied to a whangee cane
  that gave it plenty of whip. Laxey was spot, and broke with a ten-yard
  drive. Then I teed up and drove with a good follow-through action that
  carried me round several circles before I could stop.</p>

  <p>"I did better the next time, and made my ball rather sorry that it had
  been making fun of me. Laxey had a bad lie and, though he lofted his ball
  with the putter (as I said, the whangee <i>did</i> give it 'whip'), he
  didn't clear the hutments. After he had cannoned off the roof of a
  'Nissen' into the cook-house I took my turn, and to my disgust pulled
  into a trench that formed part of our old support line.</p>

  <p>"'Our ways lie apart now, old melon,' I said, 'and I should advise you
  to follow my example and get your batman to keep the count. Otherwise
  your play will be affected by arithmetical troubles.'</p>

  <p>"Accompanied by my faithful Wilkins I found my ball and reviewed the
  situation. The driver and hockey stick were hopeless for mashie shots,
  but Wilkins reported a practicable C.T. a few yards to the right, leading
  to the front line, and some gently sloping revetting from thence to the
  level. Luckily the C.T. had plenty of length to each traverse, and when I
  emerged in the open with my sixty-seventh Laxey was only just getting
  clear of the huts, having been badly bunkered in the coal dump. He made
  good progress from there, but I got into the rough&mdash;a regular
  Gruyère of shell-holes. While I was attempting to hack my way through I
  heard a delighted gurgle of laughter and turned round to see half-a-dozen
  of the Chinks sitting on their hams and watching me with undisguised
  jubilation.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span>

  <p>"'Send them away, Wilkins,' I said irritably. 'Can't you see they're
  putting me off my game?'</p>

  <p>"Wilkins shoved them off, and I took the old German line with a rush.
  While I was so to speak consolidating, a runner arrived from Laxey asking
  for the loan of a pair of wire-cutters.</p>

  <p>"''E's 'ung up on the wire, Sir,' said the runner, 'an' cursing the
  artillery somethink awful from force of 'abit.'</p>

  <p>"I sent a pair of nail-scissors with my compliments, and would Mr.
  Laxey kindly inform me what was his score to date? Laxey returned the
  scissors, saying that he found he could manage better with a tie-clip,
  and his score at 15.30 hours was 346, please. Cheered by the knowledge
  that I was a matter of twenty to the good, I executed a brilliant dribble
  along a ditch, neatly tricked a couple of saplings and finished with a
  long spinning-jenny into a camouflaged strong point. By this time Wilkins
  was in such a maze of mathematics that he hadn't time to scare off the
  coolies, who were tumbling up in large numbers and giving a generous meed
  of applause.</p>

  <p>"Towards the 400 Laxey, who also had a good gallery of Chinks, was
  losing touch, and I advised him by runner to change direction. He thanked
  me, but said that, in view of the difficult nature of the terrain, he had
  decided to work round from a flank. Feeling that I was nearing the
  objective I organised a series of approach-shots with the driver, and
  sent to ask Laxey if he would care to accept fifty start. However, having
  foozled into a ruined pillbox, I reduced the offer by half, and later on,
  confident&mdash;not to say insulting&mdash;reports from Laxey induced me
  to withdraw the concession altogether.</p>

  <p>"At 16.30 hours precisely, amid intense excitement on the part of the
  Celestial audience, we arrived at the deciding crump-hole simultaneously.
  When I say we arrived, I mean that Laxey had an eight-yard putt from a
  good lie&mdash;an easy proposition with the whangee putter&mdash;and I
  was ten yards away in as wicked a little crevice as you could wish to
  find.</p>

  <p>"'If it doesn't shake your nerve, skipper,' said Laxey, 'I might
  mention that my score is 543.'</p>

  <p>"'You'd better give me the game, then,' I answered. 'I'm but a modest
  520.'</p>

  <p>"'Not jolly likely. You'll take at least twenty to get out of that
  burrow. Besides, I know Wilkins is rotten at figures, and I claim a
  recount.'</p>

  <p>"An audit and scrutiny showed that we were both 537, and although
  Laxey held a distinct advantage in position I decided on a strenuous
  effort to halve the game. I took a firm stance and the hockey stick and
  let drive for the hole with a tremendous pickaxe stroke. Instantly there
  was a blinding flash and an explosion, and, when we had finished picking
  sand out of our ears and eyes and allayed the excitement of the Chinks,
  we discovered my ball comfortably nestling in the crump-hole.</p>

  <p>"'If assistance with derelict Mills bombs is allowed,' said Laxey,
  'we've halved.'</p>

  <p>"'On the contrary,' I replied, 'as your ball is apparently missing
  I've won.'</p>

  <p>"And, if you believe me, we couldn't find Laxey's ball anywhere,
  though we had seen it but a minute or two before. So I claimed the ten
  francs; but I didn't mention to Laxey that the following morning I was
  passing a group of the coolies and saw them with an object that looked
  suspiciously like Laxey's ball, hammering it with a stick and trying to
  make it say <i>Bang</i>!"</p>

<h2>LITTLE TALES FOR YOUNG PLUMBERS.</h2>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">The Conversion of George.</font></p>

  <p>George was a plumber by trade and a striker by occupation. He did his
  plumbing in his holidays, when he was not busy. He liked plumbing, as it
  gave his throat a rest. He was really the Champion Long Distance Plumber
  of the World and had gained the R.S.V.P.'s gold medal for doing the
  back-in-a-minute-to-get-your-tools in more than two hours. And his heart
  was as tender as his feet. If he heard a clock strike he longed to strike
  in sympathy, so that hard-hearted employers who knew George's weakness
  always kept their time-pieces muffled.</p>

  <p>The bursting of our water-pipe was the means of bringing me into touch
  with George. He joined our bathing-party in the front hall, and said
  simply, "I am the plumber." Just like that. He then said that he would
  swim home for his tools, as he had forgotten the can-opener. When he got
  back Auntie was drowned.</p>

  <p>He did not stay long, as he had to go on sympathetic strike with the
  graziers. He was not really a grazier as well as a plumber, but his heart
  was so tender that he couldn't keep on plumbing so as to give
  satisfaction, he said, as long as the graziers were not grazing, so to
  speak. It didn't really matter. Nothing matters nowadays. I just went out
  and sold the house as it stood for an enormous sum and emigrated on the
  proceeds to Tooting Bec.</p>

  <p>But this tract deals with George and his conversion, and has been
  written specially to be put into the hands of young plumbers. Let us see
  then how George gave up his sinful ways and how his heart was
  changed.</p>

  <p>It began with his tooth&mdash;an old, old tooth. It had done some work
  in its time, but it decided to strike. And strike it did. George gave it
  beer&mdash;Government beer&mdash;and it hit George back, good and hard.
  George then began to talk to it. He asked if it knew what it was doing
  of. He threatened it with more Government beer if it didn't get on with
  its work more quiet-like. The tooth sat up then and bit George.</p>

  <p>"All right, young fellow my lad," said George; "you come out along o'
  me, and come quiet. You're going to the dentist's, you are, and he'll
  Bolshevise you proper, he will."</p>

  <p>The tooth stopped aching at once; it was a wisdom tooth. But George
  knew it was only just lying low, to break out into sympathetic strike on
  Monday morning. So out he rushed with it and took it to the dentist. I
  was the dentist.</p>

  <p>I led George gently by the hand to my nice little chair and told him
  what beautiful weather we were having for the time of the year. I said,
  "Open, please," and George opened. I then took my nice little steel
  whangee, beautifully polished, and tickled the delinquent. A gentle
  tickle and no more. I didn't really go far&mdash;not farther than his
  back collar-stud&mdash;but George said things as if I were a
  capitalist.</p>

  <p>I then said coldly, "It doesn't hurt!" I am what is known in the
  profession as a painless dentist and rarely feel much pain.</p>

  <p>I capped his repartee by remarking, "Keep open, please." That always
  shuts 'em up. George kept open. I then spilt some cotton-wool in his
  tooth and put up some scaffolding in the entrance of his mouth, and said
  nonchalantly (I always charge extra for this), "I have forgotten my
  niblick; keep open. I shall be back anon." I then went out and had
  lunch.</p>

  <p>When I came back George was still keeping open, but he looked at me
  very wicked with his blue eyes and asked me from under the cotton-wool if
  I ever intended to finish my ruddy little job.</p>

  <p>I said, "Dear brother and oppressed fellow-striker, I regret that I
  cannot. I see by <i>The Dentists' Daily</i> that our Union has declared a
  sympathetic strike with the Amalgamated Excavators and Theological
  Students. You have my sympathy. I can no more."</p>

  <p>George tried to persuade me as we went downstairs together, bumping
  our heads on each step in turn, but it was of no avail.</p>

  <p>I do not however regret my pious invention, as I hear that George is a
  changed man. Being intelligent, he thought things over for himself,
  instead of letting a man in a red tie do it for him, and after six weeks
  came to the conclusion that a strike is a game that more than one can
  play at. He strikes now only in his holidays. He never now forgets his
  tools or leaves taps running. He does a good day's plumb for a good day's
  pay. And he sings while he works. Strange to say that little tooth of his
  has given up striking too.</p>

  <p>But yet it is not strange, for, as I told you, it was a wisdom
  tooth.</p>

<h2>FIXES THE HARE.</h2>

  <p>I found Andy Devenish, of Castle Devenish, Co. Cork, in Piccadilly. He
  was wearing an old frieze overcoat, the bottom of which had suffered from
  a puppy's teeth, and a bowler hat with a guard-ring dangling from its
  flat brim. His freckled nose was squashed against Fore's window as he
  gazed wistfully at the sporting prints within. I led him gently
  westwards, pushed him into the club's best arm-chair, placed the wine of
  our mutual country at his elbow and spoke to him severely.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," said I, "how is it I find you thus, got up in the height of
  fashion, loitering with intent to lady-kill in this colossal
  rabbit-warren which knows no hound but the sleuth, no horse but the
  towel? How is it, man, when there's a Peace on and the month is February
  and there's no frost south of the Liffey? Why aren't you dressed in a
  coat that is pink in spots and a cap that is velvet in places, flipping
  over your stone-faced banks on a rampageous four-year-old that you bought
  for ten pounds down, ten pounds some time, a sack of seed oats and an old
  saddle, and will eventually palm off on an Englishman at Ballsbridge for
  two hundred cash? What about the hounds? The Ballinknock Versatiles? What
  are they doing without their master? Going for improving country walks
  with Patsey Mike, two and two like young ladies from a seminary, or
  sitting up on their benches, a tear in every eye, wailing, 'Oh, where is
  our wandering boy tonight?'</p>

  <p>"And what about the Ballinknock foxes, eh? Aren't they entitled to
  some consideration? Didn't they carry on patiently for four dull years
  while you were in France, learning to walk in the cavalry, on the
  understanding that you'd make up for it when you got back by hunting them
  every day of the week? Have you no love or sympathy for dumb animals? Why
  are you here? What are you flying from? Tell me your dread secret. Is it
  debt, arson, murder&mdash;or is some woman threatening to marry you?"</p>

  <p>Andy growled into his whiskey-and-soda, then suddenly pointed out of
  the window. "See the advertisement on that bus?"</p>

  <p>"<font class="sc">'Mind the Widow'</font>," I read, "'shrieking comedy
  by Cosmo&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"No, not that one," Andy grumbled; "t'other."</p>

  <p>It was a picture of a smiling gentleman with a head that gleamed like
  patent leather. The gentleman attributed his happiness to the fact that
  he mixed "Florazora" cream with his scalp. "Florazora Cream," I read,
  "fixes the hair. Subtly perfumed with honey and flowers. Imparts a lustre
  and&mdash;" The bus resumed its journey.</p>

  <p>I studied Andy's head. Normally it looks as though he had been mopping
  out a rusty drain with it. It was quite normal, every hair on end and
  pointing in a different direction.</p>

  <p>"Well, what of Florazora?" I asked. "It's evident she has never
  entered into your life, at any rate."</p>

  <p>"That's all you know about it," said Andy. "They're sitting up for me
  with blunderbusses and brickbats at home, and 'Florazora' is the
  cause."</p>

  <p>"But how?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Ye'll discover if ye'll let me speak for a half a minute. I may admit
  to you I was very sweet on a little girl that was staying with the
  MacManuses a while back, so I bought a bottle of that stuff to keep my
  hair down while I was pitching her the yarn. I cornered the lass alone in
  the MacManus' drawing-room, went down on my knees and threw off a dandy
  proposal I had learnt by heart out of a book. The girl curled about all
  over the sofa with emotion, and for a bit I thought my eloquence was
  doing it. Then I perceived she was near shaken to pieces with laughter.
  Couldn't think why till I happened to catch sight of myself in a mirror
  and saw that my darned old hair had come unstuck again and was bobbing up
  all over my head, not singly as it is now, but a cockatoo tuft at a time,
  thanks to 'Florazora.' I rose up off the MacManus carpet and ran all the
  way home."</p>

  <p>"Still I don't see&mdash;" I began.</p>

  <p>"Ye never will if ye don't give me a chance to tell ye," said
  Andy.</p>

  <p>"Do ye remember that greasy divil Peter Flynn that owns a draper's
  shop in Ballinknock main street? A fat man he is with the flowing locks
  of a stump orator, given to fancy waistcoats and a frock-coat&mdash;very
  dressy. Ye'd see him standing at the shop-door on fair-days, bobbing to
  the women and how-dy-doin' the country boys the way he'd tout a vote or
  two, he being the leading Sinn Fein organiser down our way now. Anyhow he
  and his raparees got after me and the hunt, on account of me evicting a
  tenant that hadn't <span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"
  id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span> paid a penny of rent for seven years and
  didn't ever intend to. They hinted to the decent poor farmers round about
  that there'd be ricks fired and cows ripped if they allowed me to hunt
  their lands, so I got stopped everywhere. I had land enough of my own to
  carry on with, so I hunted there till the foxes and hares gave out, which
  they precious soon did, seeing that half the neighbourhood was out
  shooting, trapping, poisoning and lurching them.</p>

  <p>"I bought a stag from a feller in Limerick and chased that for a bit;
  then on a 'tween day, when I was away and the deer out grazing in the
  demesne, somebody slipped a brace of Mauser bullets into it, and that
  form of diversion was likewise at an end. As far as I could see an animal
  wouldn't stand a ten minutes' chance in my country unless it were an
  armadillo.</p>

  <p>"I wrote to the War Office, asking them could they kindly oblige me
  with the loan of a lively little tank for pursuing purposes, but got no
  answer. I guess <font class="sc">Winston</font> had a liver on him that
  morning. So there was nothing for it but to give up the hounds. I went
  and broke the sad news to Patsey Mike, who was mixing stirabout at the
  time. 'Oh, God save us, don't be doing that, Sor,' says he. 'Hoult hard a
  day or so and I'll be afther findin' some little object to hunt, that
  them dirthy blagyards won't shoot at all.'</p>

  <p>"Two mornings later he turned up, dragging something in an
  oat-sack.</p>

  <p>"I have it here that'll course out before the houn's like a
  shootin'-star,' says he.</p>

  <p>"'What is it?' says I.</p>

  <p>"The rogue put his hand in the sack and drew out a yellow mongrel
  dog.</p>

  <p>"'Where did ye get that?' says I.</p>

  <p>"'Shure didn't I borry it?' says he.</p>

  <p>"'And who did ye borrow it from?' says I.</p>

  <p>"'From Misther Flynn, no less,' says he. ''Tis his little foxey pet
  dog.'</p>

  <p>"'Does Mr. Flynn know you borrowed it from him?' says I.</p>

  <p>"'Begob that he does not,' says he. 'Mr. Flynn is beyond in Youghal
  and I borryed it in the dark dead of night over the yard wall. Faith,
  he'll run home like a flick of lightning, he's that scared, the same
  dog.'</p>

  <p>"'Ye did well,' said I; 'but will the hounds chase him?'</p>

  <p>"'That they will, Sor. What with foxes one day, stags the next and
  hares the next, there's sorra a born thing they wouldn't hunt given
  there's smell enough in it,' says the lad. 'Have ye the laste little
  trace of aniseed in the house that you could drench the crature with the
  way the houn's would folly him?'</p>

  <p>"Divil a drop of aniseed or anything else had I on the place, and I
  stood there scratching my ear with my crop wondering what to do, when
  suddenly I remembered that relic of my courting days, 'Florazora.' 'I
  have it,' I said; 'I've got something that'll fix <i>that</i> hare all
  right.'</p>

  <p>"I fetched the bottle and rubbed a handful or so of the stuff well
  into Mr. Flynn's pet dog and let him go with a flip of my whip lash to
  help him on his way. He lit out for home as though the devil had kicked
  him, yelling blue murder and laying a trail of flowers <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span> and honey
  across the country so thick you could pretty nigh eat it. I gave him a
  fair start, then laid the hounds on and we had a five-mile point, going
  like a steeplechase all the way. Flynn lives in a lonely house about half
  a mile out of Ballinknock, and the 'bag-man' got home to it and through
  the wee dog-hole into the yard with just six inches to spare.</p>

  <p>"Patsey went over the wall and borrowed the dog three times after
  that. It was no trouble at all. Flynn was still away in Youghal, and his
  housekeeper was that deaf Gabriel would have to announce the Crack of
  Doom to her on his fingers. But it was too good to last. On the fourth
  day we were nearing Flynn's house, the dog leading the pack by not fifty
  yards, when I saw him cut across a field to the left, while the hounds
  tumbled into a little boreen that runs up from the railway-station and
  went streaking down it singing out as if they were on a breast-high scent
  and in view.</p>

  <p>"'Begob,' says I to Patsey, 'they've changed; they're running a hare,
  I believe.'</p>

  <p>"'Tis a hare in a frock-coat then, Sor,' says he, pointing with his
  whip.</p>

  <p>"Sure enough it was a man they were after. I saw him then galloping
  down the boreen for dear life, coat-tails flying, hair streaming, terror
  in his big white face. Flynn! I did my damdest, but I had no hope of
  stopping them, not in that little lane. When I came out on the high-road
  I found what was left of the politician half-way up a telegraph post,
  like a treed cat, screeching and scrambling and calling on the Saints,
  with old Actress swinging by her teeth to the tails of his shirt,
  Cruiskeen ripping the trousers off him a leg at a time, and the rest of
  the pack leaping under him like the surf of the sea.</p>

  <p>"I nearly rolled off my mare with laughter, though well I knew the
  screeching scarecrow up the pole would have me drawn and quartered for
  that day's work. I whipped the hounds off in the end, took 'em by road to
  Fermoy that same evening and boxed 'em to my brother-in-law in Carlow.
  'Twas fortunate I did, for my kennels were burnt to the ground that
  night."</p>

  <p>Andy sighed, drained his glass and gazed regretfully at the
  bottom.</p>

  <p>"H-m, ye-es, but there's still a point I would like cleared up," said
  I. "What made the pack change and chase Flynn?"</p>

  <p>"Appears he was strongly addicted to 'Florazora' too," said Andy.</p>

<h2>THE BEST OF THINGS.</h2>

  <p>"The New Poor?" said Holder, like myself, one of them. "Nonsense.
  There are none. There are people who will not use their imaginations, of
  course. They are poor, but not newly so. This so-called new poverty
  doesn't touch me. True, the money I make will not go so far as it used
  to, but my imagination goes very much farther. I have trained it,
  encouraged it, my wife's and boy's too. We have cast off the absurd
  restraints imposed by the law of probability. In the old days, when I
  used to think, say, of motors, I was invariably badgered by the spectre
  of improbability. I used to think of a four-hundred-pound car, or
  perhaps, in a daring moment, my thoughts would creep timidly, like mice
  out into a still kitchen, on to the six-hundred-pound plane, only to
  scurry back to the lower plane almost instantly. <i>Now</i> I've thrown
  all that overboard. Rubbish! When I think of motors I think in terms of
  Rolls-Royces. Why think cheaply? It's a poor imagination that won't run
  to a six-cylinder car at least. Strictly, I shall never own a real motor
  scooter. What of it? In my mind I use Rolls-Royces. We've rather worked
  the thing up at home. Come and dine with us and see for yourself."</p>

  <p>We had sausages and mashed potatoes, with water. And I may say that
  never have I enjoyed a meal more. You see, Holder kept on telling us all
  the time about the famous dinner which now, owing to the War, we should
  never really eat, but which we were at perfect liberty to imagine we were
  eating. I am sorry you were not there. The <i>hors d'&#339;uvres</i>!
  Holder describes <i>hors d'&#339;uvres</i> better than any man I know.
  Oh, masterly, the colour ... <font class="sc">Ruskin</font>, perhaps.
  Anyhow, he carried us quite away.</p>

  <p>His wife chose oysters. His description of oysters, instantly
  furnished, was a little gem&mdash;a pearl, silver-grey, so much so that I
  too chose oysters. His little boy, Dickie, chose caviare; but he really
  did not care for it. He bit on a piece of button in his sausage, poor
  child. That was why he did not appreciate the caviare. But Holder
  distracted his mind with some very remarkable mushroom
  soup&mdash;<i>potage de champignons</i>&mdash;a brilliant word-sketch. We
  all chose it.</p>

  <p>For fish there was saus&mdash;pardon me, sole. The little lad, Dickie,
  chose salmon; but Holder reminded him that he had had salmon the previous
  evening; it was out of season in any case, and he described how the sole
  tasted that probably Dickie will never touch. The boy appeared to enjoy
  it immensely.</p>

  <p>I think it was the game, simple roast partridges, exquisitely cooked,
  which Mrs. Holder enjoyed most. Her eyes were frankly shining as she
  pensively chewed the third quarter of her sausage, and she thrilled to
  the juices of the partridge of the dinner she could no longer hope really
  to eat, but which Holder, thank God, would often describe, at any rate
  until a tax is put on conversation. Even then something might be
  done&mdash;deaf and dumb language, possibly&mdash;an evasion, I admit,
  but even the New Poor must eat occasionally.</p>

  <p>We all enjoyed the game course most, with the exception of Dickie. The
  lad had finished his sausage, and mashed potato alone is not inspiring.
  But that great man, Holder, noticed it in time, and he satisfied the
  child with a word-painting of the brown crisp skin of cooked goose. Then
  we drank some magnificent wine. Holder <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span> ransacked the English
  language for it. A vivifying champagne.</p>

  <p>But enough of food, or you will think we were gourmands. None of us
  cared for any sweets after such a meal. And that is what I like about the
  Holders: with them enough is as good as the feast they will never
  have.</p>

  <p>After dinner we smoked a very fine cigar in the imaginary conservatory
  which Holder has just run up, and I have rarely, if ever, heard a better
  description of men smoking cigars in a conservatory. Next, Holder played
  me a fast game of billiards. He allowed me to choose my own table, and I
  picked the most expensive in the catalogue. Dickie marked for us. Then he
  went to bed. I heard his father whisper a most convincing description of
  eiderdowns and real wool blankets when he kissed him. He is only a very
  little boy&mdash;big blue eyes, you know, like a girl's; they watered a
  little. Excitement....</p>

  <p>It was a clear moonlit night with a touch of frost in the air, so Mrs.
  Holder rang for the visionary footman, a good-looking, most willing,
  sensible man, according to Holder's quick portrait of him, who piled up
  some great logs on a bank of coals of a positively fantastic size, and we
  gathered round to enjoy a run in the brand-new, latest model Rolls-Royce
  which is one of the special things which Holder will never possess in
  this world. Ah, but she was a queen of cars, and the best of cars always
  run better at night. I wonder why. So smoothly silky, so dreamily
  sweet-running, a pouring of cream! I wish I could convey to you the satin
  sound of her transmission, the low golden purr of her gears, the fanning
  of her velvet wings&mdash;wheels, that is. I would sooner ride in that
  verbal car of Holder's than walk round the real backyard that is my own,
  unless I fall behind with the rent, as I begin to fear I shall....</p>

  <p>Down the dreamy moon-drenched highways, across the magic
  silver-flecked moors, we climbed on the wings of the peregrine to the
  keen, cold uplands, soared awhile, then dropped to the warm and sheltered
  valley and so home again. We felt the radiator, Holder and I, and it was
  quite cool. <i>She</i> will never boil on a stiff hill. Mrs. Holder was
  glowing from her ride; for an instant she looked pink and pretty; she had
  lost that wistful pinched look.</p>

  <p>I went inside for a phrase or so of Holder's admirable idea of what
  cherry brandy should be. We chatted for a little about the estate that he
  will never purchase, and then I left, having promised to go round there
  to-morrow for a little shooting. It will be hot work among the pheasants
  if Holder has not lost his voice.</p>

  <p>He and his wife came down the drive to the entrance-gates with me.</p>

  <p>"Good-night," they said; "we're glad you've enjoyed yourself."</p>

  <p>Holder was a little hoarse, for he is a generous host. I think too the
  motor run had tired them both, for their faces were again a little
  haggard; and the wind had brought tears to the eyes of Mrs. Holder.</p>

  <p>So I said good-bye to them&mdash;and to Jack, their elder boy, whom
  they will never see again. He lies in France. But, you understand, it was
  as if he had been with us all again for a little while that evening.</p>

<h3>MUSICAL AMENITIES.</h3>

  <p>The connection of occultism with music was recently discussed by Mr.
  <font class="sc">Cyril Scott</font> in his interesting volume on
  Modernism in Music. It is satisfactory to know that the subject is not to
  be allowed to drop. Grave discontent is rife in orchestral circles at the
  monopoly enjoyed at spiritualist <i>séances</i> by the tambourine, and it
  is reported that Mr. <font class="sc">Ernest Newman</font>, the
  distinguished and outspoken musical critic, will shortly deliver a public
  lecture on behalf of the admission of other instruments to these
  mysteries, and in particular the tuba. The claim of the tuba, Mr. <font
  class="sc">Newman</font> holds, is not only based on the profundity of
  its tones, but upon long literary tradition. Nothing could be more
  conclusive than the reference in the old Latin hymn:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Tuba mirum spargens sonum</p>
      <p>Per sepulcra regionum."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It is anticipated that the discussion will be attended by Signor <font
  class="sc">Marconi</font>, Lord <font class="sc">Dunsany</font>, Mr.
  <font class="sc">Yeats</font> and Lieutenant <font
  class="sc">Jones</font>, the author of <i>The Road to En-Dor</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Meanwhile the conflicting current of musical materialism is running
  strong. <i>The Daily Mail</i>, always in the van of artistic progress,
  has espoused the cause of the insurgent Georgians with intrepid zeal. Mr.
  <font class="sc">Julius Harrison</font> is extolled in a leading article
  for finding a theme for an orchestral work, not in any of the misty or
  metaphysical abstractions which appealed to the effete Victorian
  composers, but in plums. And, mind you, not Carlsbad, but honest
  Worcestershire plums, without any Teutonic taint. Mr. <font
  class="sc">Julius Harrison's</font> patriotic example is not likely to be
  lost on his brother composers. Indeed it is asserted on credible
  authority that Mr. <font class="sc">Granville Bantock</font>, who has
  completely forsworn all Oriental and exotic subjects, is engaged on a
  gigantic symphony, with choral interludes, entitled "Yorkshire Pudding;"
  and that Mr. <font class="sc">Josef Holbrooke</font> is collaborating
  with Lord <font class="sc">Howard de Walden</font> in a romantic
  historical opera in fifteen Acts called "From Woad to Broadcloth."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Bernard Shaw</font>, who, it may be necessary to
  remind youthful readers, was a musical critic on <i>The Star</i> and
  <i>The World</i> before he achieved fame as a dramatist, has been causing
  his friends and admirers serious misgivings by his article on Sir <font
  class="sc">Edward Elgar</font> in a new musical journal, <i>Music and
  Letters</i>. Sir <font class="sc">Edward Elgar</font> has a great
  following; he has written oratorios; he is an O.M.; yet Mr. <font
  class="sc">Shaw</font> salutes him as the greatest English composer, the
  true lineal descendant of <font class="sc">Beethoven</font>, one of the
  Immortals and the only candidate for Westminster Abbey! To find Mr. <font
  class="sc">Shaw</font> taking a majority view is bad enough; it is a case
  of proving false to the tradition of a lifetime&mdash;a moral suicide.
  But why drag in <font class="sc">Beethoven</font>? So left-handed a
  compliment prompts the suspicion that, after all, what appears to be
  eulogy is in reality nothing more than an essay in adroitly dissembled
  obloquy. <i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, Mr. <font class="sc">Shaw</font> would
  not thank Sir <font class="sc">Edward Elgar</font> for calling him, for
  example, the Voltaire <i>de nos jours</i>. What he does enjoy is the
  frank disparagement of Mr. <font class="sc">Wilfrid Blunt</font>, who
  describes him in the second volume of <i>My Diary</i>, just published, as
  "an ugly fellow, his face a pasty-white, with a red nose and a rusty red
  beard, and little slaty-blue eyes."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>An interesting but, we regret to say, decidedly hostile estimate of
  Mr. <font class="sc">Lloyd George</font> as a musician appears in the
  columns of a leading anti-Coalition daily. The critic discusses the <font
  class="sc">Premier</font> both as vocalist and instrumentalist, and in
  both capacities finds him sadly wanting. The volume of his voice is
  small, the timbre is unpleasant, the production faulty and the intonation
  far from pure. Admitting that Mr. <font class="sc">Lloyd George</font>
  has a certain flexibility and facility common to all Welsh singers, the
  critic condemns his habit of resorting to an emotional tremolo which
  frequently degenerates into a mere "wobble." The <font
  class="sc">Premier</font>, he continues, shows agility and spirit in
  florid passages, but his declamation lacks dignity and his articulation
  is often indistinct. As a pianist he is equally unsatisfactory; his
  repertory is extremely limited and he is quite unable to interpret the
  complex harmonies of the Russian School.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A painful example of Mr. <font class="sc">Lloyd George's</font>
  ignorance is forthcoming in the astounding fact that he is, or was, under
  the impression that Karsavina was the name of a town, and that the only
  musician of the name of Corelli was the author of <i>The Sorrows of
  Satan</i>. The critic concludes with a masterly analysis of the results
  of these short-comings on the vitality of the Coalition Cabinet, already
  weakened by the withdrawal of Mr. <font class="sc">Balfour</font>, a very
  sound and accomplished musician of the old school.</p>

<h2>GUINEA-PIGS.</h2>

  <p>It was with ill-concealed trepidation that I approached the Pontifical
  Personage who presides over Messrs. Barkrod and Tomridge's Zoological
  Department. The recollection of my previous and only encounter with him
  still burned in my memory. I had gone thither with a young nephew on whom
  in a rash moment I had urged the satisfaction to be derived from the
  study of natural history and he had countered with a birthday and a
  demand that I should convert precept to practice by providing him with a
  pet.</p>

  <p>The P.P. greeted us with benignant expectancy. His white apron merely
  accentuated the obvious fact that he had come in a limousine. I have
  since decided that he mistook me for an eccentric peer. It seems that
  eccentric peers and struggling journalists are apt to provide the same
  air of sartorial abandon to the eye of the uninitiated.</p>

  <p>It was the young nephew, however, who made the running. The entire
  menagerie whistled, barked, sat up on its hind legs, performed acrobatic
  feats and said, "Scratch poor Polly," at his discriminating behest.
  Finally he reached a point where he simply could not decide between a
  Goliath cockatoo at £22 10<i>s</i>. and a white-faced Douroucouli at
  twenty-seven guineas.</p>

  <p>At this juncture I insinuated myself into the discussion, and by the
  exercise of subtle pressure got him to compromise on a pair of white rats
  at half-a-crown. Never shall I forget the look of majestic contempt with
  which the Personage withered me as he extracted two torpid rodents from a
  congeries of their kith and, holding them by their pink tails, dropped
  them into a paper bag with the air of a Marchese depositing alms in the
  palm of a lazzarone.</p>

  <p>Not lightly indeed did I again enter into the Presence. But on this
  occasion duty called. The troubadour with lady's glove in helm never
  showed a bolder front than the journalist in search of copy. And
  boldness, it seemed, was to be rewarded. As I approached the Pontifical
  Personage it appeared certain that he did not remember me. And why, I
  asked myself, should he? Had I been the Duke of <font
  class="sc">Bedford</font> or the President of the Ladies' Kennel Club I
  might have expected a place in his august memory. But an insignificant
  uncle buying white rats&mdash;it was absurd, of course, to fear
  recognition.</p>

  <p>I plunged straightway <i>in medias res</i>. "I have here," I said, "a
  journal of unimpeachable veracity which declares that the Pasteur
  Institute in Paris is suffering from a guinea-pig shortage. Please oblige
  me with your expert opinion on this momentous matter."</p>

  <p>The P.P. smiled slightly, cleared his throat and, waving me to the
  further end of the menagerie, proceeded to answer my question. "The
  common or Sicilian guinea-pig," he began, "the <i>Porculus Auriferus
  Excubitor</i> of <font class="sc">Buffon</font>, is still fairly common,
  though I may say that it is many a day since they could be purchased for
  a guinea. An allied species, the Chinese or edible guinea-pig, the Sing
  Fat Soo of the Cantonese restaurateur, is indeed quite plentiful, but for
  some reason or other has never found favour with the leading English
  fanciers. The fact is that since the War our customers have become more
  discerning, and the common guinea-pig, being no longer called for, is not
  bred and has therefore ceased to be available for scientific purposes. A
  few of the art shades, notably <i>tête-nègre</i> and <i>beige</i> pigs,
  are still in request by the furriers; but the public demand is for
  something more select.</p>

  <p>"Now here"&mdash;and reaching into an adjoining cage the Pontifical
  Personage extracted between finger and thumb a pinch of twitching
  fluff&mdash;"is the most highly-prized of the race, the blue Himalayan
  pig. Only five specimens have so far reached this country. The first pair
  were presented to the Duchess of Snoblands by the Maharajah of Khidmutgar
  about three years ago, but the sow met with an unfortunate accident in
  her ladyship's absence, being dipped into a box of face-powder by a
  thoughtless maidservant. The third specimen, a fine boar, was brought
  from China as the mascot of H.M.S. <i>Colossus</i>, but just after
  reaching harbour was accidentally devoured by the ship's cat. The
  remaining two I have here. They are expensive, of course, a
  hundred-and-five guineas the pair, but quite unique.</p>

  <p>"Of greater zoological interest perhaps is this little fellow,
  <i>Porculus Auriferus Decaudatus</i>, an arboreal species from the
  Solomon Islands; or the striated guinea-pig of Central Nicaragua, which I
  am happily able to show you."</p>

  <p>He placed Nicaragua's most valuable product in my hand, and it
  promptly bit me. That I did not drop it into a cageful of terrier-pups
  was wholly due to the native vigour with which <i>Striatus</i> hung
  on.</p>

  <p>"The price of that is forty-five guineas," continued the Pontifical
  Person smoothly, as he restored it to its cage. I shivered.</p>

  <p>"Now here," he went on, "is a pig of real historic interest. I have a
  fair number of them just in from my collectors in the Persian Gulf and
  can do them at eighteen pounds the pair." He motioned me towards a larger
  cage wherein a bevy of dun-coloured piglets were holding a soviet. "The
  Sumerian or Desert Pig," he explained, "of the <i>Oxyrhynchus Papyri</i>,
  erroneously identified by <font class="sc">Grenfell</font> and <font
  class="sc">Hunt</font> with the Southern form of the Tree Hyrax."</p>

  <p>It was at this point that my intelligence forsook me. I had been
  getting on too well. It was the old story of over-confidence.</p>

  <p>"Honestly now, old chap," I said, "and strictly between ourselves, do
  you ever sell any of the little beasts?"</p>

  <p>His face lit up in a brilliant smile. "No, Sir," he replied, drawing
  himself up majestically and looking me squarely in the eye, "we keep
  these to show to inquisitive customers. <i>We only sell</i> <font
  class="sc">white rats</font>!"</p>

  <p>I fled. As I crossed the interminable length of floor that separated
  me from the door I could feel that contemptuous smile rowelling my
  shrinking vertebræ. Halfway across, the Blue Himalyan guinea-pig could
  have given me three drachms and whipped me by sheer brute strength. As I
  sped towards the door an attendant opened it. It was unnecessary. I could
  easily have crept underneath it.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

  <p>"A tough hide and some facility of expression"&mdash;to quote the
  author's modest estimate of his qualifications&mdash;have enabled
  Rear-Admiral Sir <font class="sc">Douglas Brownrigg</font> to make his
  <i>Indiscretions of the Naval Censor</i> (<font
  class="sc">Cassell</font>) the liveliest book of the War that has come my
  way. Thanks to the first element in his make-up he managed to retain his
  difficult and delicate post throughout the War, and only once came into
  serious collision with any of his official superiors. As these included
  First Lords of such diverse temperament as Mr. <font
  class="sc">Churchill</font> and Lord <font class="sc">Fisher</font>, and
  First Sea Lords with such diametrically opposite views regarding
  publicity as Lord <font class="sc">Fisher</font> and Sir <font
  class="sc">Henry Jackson</font>, this was no small achievement. Thanks to
  the second element he has written a book which scarcely contains a dull
  page. Whether he is giving us a pen-picture of Mr. <font
  class="sc">Churchill</font> conducting Admiralty business from a
  sick-bed, with his head swathed in flannel and an immense cigar
  protruding from the bandage; or explaining how the legend of Lord <font
  class="sc">Kitchener's</font> survival arose from a trivial error that
  caused the news of the <i>Hampshire</i> disaster to reach Berlin a few
  minutes before it was published in London, he always writes with
  directness and <i>verve</i>. Admiral <font class="sc">Brownrigg</font>
  tells a good deal about the censorship, and illustrates his theme with
  some excellent reproductions of naval photographs before and after the
  Censor had "re-touched" them. He tells us even more about his work in a
  less familiar <i>rôle</i>, that of Publicity Agent to the Silent Service.
  It was he who arranged visits to the Fleet by more or less distinguished
  personages&mdash;"<font class="sc">Brownrigg's</font> circus parties," as
  they were dubbed in the gun-room&mdash;and who engaged authors like Mr.
  <font class="sc">Kipling</font> and artists like Sir <font
  class="sc">John Lavery</font> to describe and portray the doings of the
  Fleet and its auxiliaries. It pains me to learn, however, that "Passed by
  Censor" was only a guarantee for the harmlessness and not for the
  veracity of the stories narrated; and in particular that the famous
  "Q"-boat ruse of the demented female with the explosive baby was a pure
  work of imagination.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Without any special heralding, Mr. <font class="sc">Eric
  Leadbitter</font> seems to have stepped into the front rank, perhaps even
  to the leadership, of those active novelists whose theme is English rural
  life. I emphasize the word "active," with of course a thought for the
  master of them all, the wizard of Dorchester, at whose feet it would
  probably be fair to suppose Mr. <font class="sc">Leadbitter</font> to
  have learnt some at least of his craft. His new story, <i>Shepherd's
  Warning</i> (<font class="sc">Allen and Unwin</font>), is a quiet tale of
  life in a not specially attractive village&mdash;a tale that conquers by
  its direct humanity and by an art so delicate and so deftly concealed
  that the book has a deceptive appearance of having written itself without
  effort on the part of its author. It concerns a group of peasants,
  agricultural labourers, inhabitants of Fidding, a village gradually
  yielding to the encroachments by tram and villa of the neighbouring town.
  The simple annals of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"
  id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span> these folk, and especially of one
  family, old <i>Bob Garrett</i> and his grandsons, provide the matter of a
  tale gentle as the passage of time itself, never dull, instinct with
  quality in every line of it. Mr. <font class="sc">Leadbitter</font> has a
  method of concentration so pronounced that, once let his characters, even
  his heroine, step outside the beam that he has focussed upon Fidding, and
  they vanish utterly, till the working (apparently) of fate brings them
  back again. Even the murder in his early chapters is so lightly touched
  upon as to produce hardly any effect of violence. His sympathy with the
  life of the soil, and the human lives that are so near to it, is clearly
  absorbing; the result is that, to all save the confirmed sensationalist
  (piqued possibly by the waste of good homicide), <i>Shepherd's
  Warning</i> will also, I think, prove Reader's Delight.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mr. H. <font class="sc">Collinson Owen</font>, formerly Editor of the
  soldiers' paper, <i>The Balkan News</i>, would just love to trap you into
  an argument on the value of our Macedonian campaign as compared with
  certain other war efforts. His book, <i>Salonika and After</i> (<font
  class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</font>), shows him thirsting to accept
  battle for the cause he champions; and in the sub-title, <i>The Side-Show
  that Ended the War</i>, he fairly throws down the gauntlet. But take my
  advice and don't be drawn. He has a foreword from General <font
  class="sc">Milne</font> to support him, and an extract from <font
  class="sc">Ludendorff's</font> <i>Memoirs</i>, and a quotation from
  <i>The Times</i>. He has a very lively and convincing way of putting
  things too, and once he gets his enthusiasm fairly in hand becomes an
  uncommonly powerful advocate. Not that this volume is by any means just a
  piece of special pleading; only the author is honourably concerned to
  show both the importance and the severity of the war against the Bulgars,
  which he thinks people at home were a little inclined to disparage. I
  certainly cannot remember doing so, but, putting controversy aside, this
  book remains an adequate first-hand account of an adventure so great as
  to demand an heroic literature all its own, where it can be seen in true
  perspective. Mr. <font class="sc">Owen</font> deals delightfully with
  nights in Salonika clubland or the vagaries of King "<font
  class="sc">Tino</font>", or with the more warlike matters culminating in
  the terrific actions that held the enemy's left wing tight while our
  allies smashed his centre. An excellent book, with illustrations above
  the average and a good map handily placed.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mrs. <font class="sc">Henry Dudeney's</font> <i>Spade Work</i> (<font
  class="sc">Hurst and Blackett</font>) is a queer story queerly told. A
  musician and an art-and-crafty girl, both poor and both dull, are
  engaged. The musician, visiting his <i>fiancée</i>, now well off and
  installed in a comfortable village farm-house, lets the strong air of the
  place get into his head and falls deep in love with a yeoman's daughter,
  who in turn, stimulated by this experience, straightway succumbs (at her
  first dance in real society, into which the great lady of the village,
  her patron, has introduced her) to the suggestion that she shall spend an
  unchaperoned night on a young blood's yacht, with results usual in
  distressful fiction. However, after many tribulations she and her
  musician, now duller than ever, are united, while the jilted craftswoman
  is left "full of ideas, sumptious (<i>sic</i>), a little feverish" for
  village industries which from my impression of her mentality I should
  judge would be of a devastating order. Lovers of that charming little
  West-country village in which the author sets her scene will not easily
  forgive her for naming it and baldly cataloguing its houses and sundry
  points of its environment, leaving out most that is the essential of its
  charm. It's simply not done by authentic writers of fiction&mdash;barring
  house-agents.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Those who experienced the rapture of discovery in an exhibition last
  May of caricatures by <font class="sc">Edmund X. Kapp</font> may now
  rejoice (supposing them to command the needful guinea) that they can
  recapture this pleasure through a volume of twenty-four representative
  drawings collected under the apt title of <i>Personalities</i> (<font
  class="sc">Secker</font>). Not for me to attempt detailed consideration,
  even if it were not the duty of every amateur to fall a victim at first
  hand to Mr. <font class="sc">Kapp's</font> amazing art. But one can
  hardly pass without tribute such things as the head of the Japanese poet
  on page 1 ("Seer of Visions"), a really wonderful example of much meaning
  in few lines, or the <font class="sc">Wyndham Lewis</font>, the only
  drawing in the book in which a suggestion of cruelty tinges the satire.
  Perhaps the most directly laughter-moving pages are those devoted to the
  brilliant series of musical conductors; is this because we have all
  stared our two hours into expert familiarity with these
  variously-tailored backs? But indeed here is a volume of twenty-four
  joys, or rather twenty-five, the last being anticipation of Mr. <font
  class="sc">Kapp's</font> further activities, which I for one shall await
  with very genuine interest.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
